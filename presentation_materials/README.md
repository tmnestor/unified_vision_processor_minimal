## üöÄ How to Use

### For Presenters
1. Use `vision_transformers_slides.md` as your guide
2. Import diagrams from `presentation_diagrams/` into your slides
3. Refer to speaker notes for talking points
4. Customize with your company branding

### For Technical Deep Dives
- Reference `vision_transformers_presentation.md` for detailed explanations
- Use code examples for demonstrations
- Mathematical foundations in appendix sections

### Working with Diagrams

#### Mermaid Diagrams (Recommended)
- Edit directly in markdown files
- No dependencies needed
- Renders automatically in GitHub/GitLab
- Use VS Code with Mermaid extension for preview

#### Matplotlib Charts (For Data)
```bash
conda activate unified_vision_processor
cd presentation_materials
python generate_vit_diagrams.py
```

## üéØ Key Messages

1. **LayoutLM has reached its limits**
   - OCR dependency creates cascading failures
   - Complex 3-stage pipeline is costly to maintain
   - Accuracy plateaued at ~70% in production

2. **Vision Transformers are the solution**
   - Single model replaces entire pipeline
   - 25% accuracy improvement over LayoutLM
   - 100% success rate vs 85% with LayoutLM

3. **Migration is practical and profitable**
   - ROI within 3-4 months
   - $180K annual savings (conservative estimate)
   - Production-proven with our implementation

## üìä Presentation Flow (50 minutes)

1. **Current State: LayoutLM** (8 min)
   - Architecture and limitations
   - Production challenges
   - Why change is needed

2. **Vision Transformers** (10 min)
   - Core concepts and architecture
   - Direct comparison with LayoutLM
   - Technical advantages

3. **Why ViTs Excel** (7 min)
   - Document-specific benefits
   - Elimination of OCR dependency
   - End-to-end learning

4. **Case Study: Our Migration** (12 min)
   - Head-to-head comparison results
   - Performance improvements
   - Cost-benefit analysis

5. **Migration Strategy** (8 min)
   - Phased approach
   - Risk mitigation
   - Quick wins

6. **Q&A Session** (10 min)
   - Address specific concerns
   - Discuss implementation details
