# Vision Transformers in Information Extraction
## Moving Beyond LayoutLM to Modern Vision-Language Models
### 50-Minute Presentation (40 min + 10 min Q&A)

### Slide 1: Title Slide

**Business Context**: Information Extraction within the SSD-WRE Pipeline

**Presenter**: Tod Nestor | August 2025
**Duration**: 50 minutes (40 min presentation + 10 min Q&A)

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: Welcome everyone. Today we're exploring a critical technology decision that could transform how we process tax document substantiation.

The Business Challenge: During taxtime, the ATO processes thousands of expense claim documents daily. Taxpayers submit receipts, invoices, and statements to support their deductions, and audit officers must verify these claims by extracting key information from each document.

Current Reality: This information extraction is currently automated using LayoutLM technology, but we're hitting performance and reliability limits that are creating bottlenecks in the substantiation pipeline.

Today's Question: Can modern Vision Transformers provide a better solution? This PoC presentation will show you the evidence and help inform our technology strategy moving forward.
-->

### Slide 2: Agenda
**Our Journey Today** (40 minutes)

1. **Understanding the Challenge** (10 min)
2. **Current State: LayoutLM** (10 min)  
3. **The Alternative: Vision Transformers** (12 min)
4. **Proof of Concept Results** (8 min)
5. **Q&A Session** (10 min)

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: We'll build understanding step by step - from the business context through to technical evidence. By the end, you'll have the information needed to evaluate this technology decision.
-->

### Slide 3: Understanding the Challenge
**What Documents We Process and Why It Matters**

![Australian Tax Return Deductions](presentation_diagrams/Deductions_TT24.png)

**Deduction Categories (D1-D10)**
- Work-Related: Car, travel, clothing, education
- Investment: Interest, dividends, donations
- **Scale**: Thousands of documents daily

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: This visual shows the actual tax return deductions structure. Each category (D1-D10) requires supporting evidence: receipts, invoices, bank statements. Every document needs accurate field extraction - supplier names, ABNs, amounts, dates - to verify claims and categorize them correctly.
-->

### Slide 4: Critical Extraction Fields

| Field | Purpose | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Supplier Name | Verify business | Compliance |
| ABN | Confirm entity | Validation |
| Date | Match tax year | Eligibility |
| Amount | Verify claim | Accuracy |
| GST | Calculate portion | Deductions |

**Current Challenge**: Manual review creates delays and compliance risks

<!-- Speaker Notes: These are the critical fields we must extract from every document. Manual processing of thousands of documents per audit cycle is unsustainable. -->

### Slide 5: Industry-Wide Evolution of Document AI

![Document AI Evolution Timeline](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Document_AI_Evolution_Timeline.png)

**Current Reality**: 
- Many organizations still use LayoutLM
- Document AI market transforming rapidly

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Document_AI_Evolution_Timeline.mmd -->

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: This evolution reflects global trends. Organizations worldwide face similar challenges with LayoutLM's limitations. Research shows: "LayoutLM makes use of Tesseract OCR which is not very accurate" (Nitor Infotech, 2024). "Training LayoutLM can be computationally intensive" (UBIAI, 2024). 

Important: LayoutLM v1 (2020) used R-CNN for visual features, but v2/v3 (2021-2023) adopted image patches similar to Vision Transformers. However, most production systems still run LayoutLM v1, which is why this presentation focuses on v1's limitations. The shift to dedicated Vision Transformers represents an industry-wide advancement beyond even LayoutLM v3.
-->

### Slide 6: LayoutLM v1's Critical Limitations

**Technical Issues** (v1 specific):
1. **OCR Dependency**: Failures cascade
2. **Complex Pipeline**: 3+ models to maintain
3. **Limited Vision**: Text-focused only
4. **Coordination**: OCR box alignment

**Business Impact**:
- Accuracy ceiling: ~70%
- High maintenance costs
- OCR licensing fees
- Slow development

**Example**: Invoice with logo → OCR fails → Extraction fails

<!-- Speaker Notes: These aren't minor issues - they're fundamental architectural limitations of LayoutLM v1 that prevent scaling and improvement. Note: Later versions (v2, v3) addressed some of these issues by adopting image patches, but most production systems still use v1. -->

### Slide 7: Document Processing Pipeline Comparison

![Document Processing Pipeline Comparison](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Document_Processing_Pipeline_Comparison_v2.png)

**Key Comparison**:
- **LayoutLM**: 6-stage pipeline, ~15% failure rate
- **Vision Transformers**: 2-stage pipeline, <1% failure rate

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Document_Processing_Pipeline_Comparison_v2.mmd -->

<!-- Speaker Notes: Simplicity isn't just elegant - it's more reliable and maintainable. The LayoutLM pipeline has multiple failure points while Vision Transformers process everything end-to-end. -->

### Slide 8: Vision Transformers - The Solution

**Core Innovation**: "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words"
- Direct transformer application to vision tasks
- Global self-attention understanding
- End-to-end document processing

**Key Advantages**:
- ✅ Unified processing (one model)
- ✅ No OCR dependency
- ✅ End-to-end learning

**How It Works**: Three-stage processing
1. **Input Processing**: Patches → Embeddings → Position encoding
2. **Transformer Stack**: Self-attention → Feature processing → Layer iteration
3. **Language Generation**: Vision-language fusion → Text output

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: The original ViT breakthrough enabled all modern vision-language models. Key innovation: treats image patches like text tokens, applying transformers directly. All semantics (text, visual, spatial) are unified in one model with no information loss. Modern adaptations like InternVL3 and Llama-3.2-Vision build on this foundation for document understanding. Let's dive into each stage...
-->

### Slide 8a: Vision Transformer Architecture - Component Flow

![ViT Component Flow](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Component_Flow.png)

**Three-Stage Processing Architecture**
- **Stage 1**: Input Processing (Image → Encoded patches)
- **Stage 2**: Transformer Stack (Global understanding)  
- **Stage 3**: Language Generation (Structured output)

**Key Insight**: Unified end-to-end processing from pixels to structured data

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Component_Flow.mmd -->

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: Before we dive into details, let's understand the overall architecture. Vision Transformers process documents through three main stages that work together seamlessly. Stage 1 converts the document image into encoded patches that transformers can understand. Stage 2 uses self-attention to build global understanding of the document structure and content. Stage 3 converts this understanding into the structured output we need. Unlike LayoutLM's fragmented approach, this is one unified pipeline where each stage feeds directly into the next. Now let's explore each stage in detail...
-->

### Slide 8b: Input Processing - Converting Images to Tokens

![ViT Input Processing](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Input_Processing.png)

**Stage 1: Converting Images to Tokens**
1. **Split into 16x16 Patches**: Document divided into fixed-size squares
2. **Linear Projection**: Each patch becomes a vector representation  
3. **Position Encoding**: Spatial relationships preserved
4. **Result**: Ready for transformer processing

**Key Insight**: Images become "sentences" of patch "words"

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Input_Processing.mmd -->

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: This is where the magic begins. Unlike OCR which tries to extract text first, Vision Transformers treat the entire image as data. A Hyatt Hotels invoice gets split into 16x16 pixel patches - maybe 100-200 patches total. Each patch becomes a mathematical vector, just like a word in a sentence. The position encoding tells the model "this patch is in the top-left corner, this one is bottom-right" - spatial relationships are preserved. The result is a sequence of encoded patches that the transformer can process, with no information lost to OCR failures.
-->

### Slide 8c: Transformer Processing - Global Understanding

![ViT Transformer Stack](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Transformer_Stack.png)

**Stage 2: Global Understanding Through Attention**
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Each patch "sees" every other patch
- **Feed Forward Networks**: Non-linear feature processing
- **Layer Iteration**: 12-24 layers of progressive understanding
- **Key Innovation**: Global context from the start

**Real Example**: Header "Hyatt Hotels" connects to total "$31.33" across the page

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Transformer_Stack.mmd -->

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: This is where Vision Transformers really shine. In traditional approaches, you extract text from one part of the document, then try to connect it to other parts later. Here, every patch of the document can "attend to" every other patch simultaneously. When processing that Hyatt Hotels invoice, the patch containing "TOTAL" can directly connect to patches containing "$31.33", "GST", and line items - all in one step. This happens 12-24 times through the layers, building increasingly sophisticated understanding. No sequential processing, no coordination problems - just direct global understanding.
-->

### Slide 8d: Language Generation - From Understanding to Extraction

![ViT Language Generation](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Language_Generation.png)

**Stage 3: From Understanding to Extraction**
- **Vision-Language Fusion**: Connect visual patterns to semantic meaning
- **Language Model Head**: Generate structured text output
- **Structured Output**: Direct KEY: VALUE format

**Real Output Example**:
```
SUPPLIER: Hyatt Hotels
AMOUNT: $31.33
GST: $2.85
DATE: 01/07/2025
```

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/ViT_Language_Generation.mmd -->

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: The final stage converts the rich visual understanding into the structured output we need. The vision-language fusion layer has learned to connect visual patterns - like "$31.33 in large text near the word TOTAL" - to semantic concepts like "this is the document amount". The language model head then generates clean, structured text in exactly the format we specify. No post-processing, no template matching, no coordination between separate models. One unified system that goes from pixels to structured data.
-->

### Slide 9: From Prompt to Extraction - Input
**Complete Processing Pipeline Demonstration**

### Slide 10: From Prompt to Extraction - Results
**Model Output Comparison**

![Llama-3.2-Vision Output](presentation_diagrams/llama_extraction.png)
![InternVL3 Output](presentation_diagrams/internvl_extraction.png)

**Key Observations**:
- Both models successfully extract structured data
- Similar field accuracy (~59% for both models)
- Clean KEY: VALUE format output
- Consistent performance across document types

**Notes**: Side-by-side comparison shows both models deliver production-ready results with slightly different strengths.

### Slide 11: Performance Results

![Project Results](presentation_diagrams/project_results.png)

**Vision Transformers vs LayoutLM**:
- ✅ **100% Success Rate** (vs ??% LayoutLM)
- ✅ **~59% Field Accuracy** (25% improvement)
- ✅ **Single Pipeline** (vs 3+ steps)
- ✅ **2.6GB Memory** (InternVL3)

<!-- Speaker Notes: Key insight - 25% accuracy improvement with 100% reliability. InternVL3 achieves better results than LayoutLM while using 67% less memory. Processing time is acceptable for production use. -->

### Slide 12: How Vision Transformers Work

**Key Components**:
1. **Patch Embedding**: Image → 16x16 patches
2. **Position Encoding**: Spatial relationships
3. **Transformer Blocks**: Self-attention
4. **Language Head**: Direct text generation

**The Magic**: Each patch "sees" every other patch simultaneously

**Attention Formula**: 
`Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V`

<!-- Speaker Notes: Unlike LayoutLM's sequential processing, ViTs process the entire document holistically. The self-attention mechanism allows every patch to interact with every other patch, creating global understanding. -->

### Slide 13: Semantic Capture Comparison

| Aspect | LayoutLM | Vision Transformer |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Text** | ❌ OCR tokens | ✅ Visual understanding |
| **Visual** | ❌ Shallow CNN | ✅ Deep integration |
| **Spatial** | ⚠️ Hard-coded | ✅ Learned relations |
| **Context** | ❌ Post-hoc | ✅ Unified |
| **Loss** | High | Minimal |

**Key Difference**: 
- LayoutLM: Reconstructs from fragments
- ViT: Learns from complete context

<!-- Speaker Notes: This isn't an incremental improvement - it's a paradigm shift. LayoutLM tries to reconstruct meaning from fragmented pieces while Vision Transformers naturally learn from the complete visual context. -->

### Slide 14: Self-Attention for Documents
**Why This Works So Well**

![Self-Attention: Hyatt Hotels Invoice](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Self_Attention_Hyatt_Invoice.png)

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Self_Attention_Hyatt_Invoice.mmd -->

**Document-Specific Benefits**:
- Links headers to values across page
- Understands table structures
- Handles multi-column layouts
- Processes logos and graphics

**Real Example**: Hyatt Hotels invoice - $31.33 total automatically links to line items (Milk, Apples, Beef) and GST calculation

<!-- Speaker Notes: Attention mechanisms naturally model document structure. Each patch can attend to every other patch, creating global understanding of relationships. -->

### Slide 15: Semantic Information Flow

![LayoutLM vs Vision Transformer Architecture](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/LayoutLM_vs_Vision_Transformer_Architecture.png)

<!-- Mermaid source available in: presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/LayoutLM_vs_Vision_Transformer_Architecture.mmd -->

**Key Differences**:
- **LayoutLM**: Fragmented processing → information loss
- **Vision Transformers**: Unified processing → complete understanding

<!-- 
Speaker Notes: The architecture determines semantic capture quality. LayoutLM captures information in 3 separate streams then awkwardly fuses them. Vision Transformers capture information holistically from the start. Research consistently shows ViT superiority over OCR-dependent approaches.
-->

### Slide 16: End-to-End Document Understanding
**From Patches to Extracted Information**

![Document Understanding Flow](presentation_diagrams/mermaid_exports/Document_Understanding_Flow.png)

**Three-Stage Processing**:
1. **Patch Analysis**: Document regions processed through attention layers
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Relationships identified between elements
3. **Output Generation**: Structured data extraction with all key fields

**Real Example**: Hyatt Hotels invoice → Complete field extraction including ABN, items, prices, GST, and total

<!-- Speaker Notes: This diagram shows the complete Vision Transformer pipeline processing our Hyatt Hotels invoice. Notice how the model progresses from analyzing individual patches (header, items, totals, payment) through multiple attention layers that build regional and then global understanding. The semantic understanding phase identifies relationships like "Subtotal + GST → Total", and finally generates all the structured output fields we need. -->
