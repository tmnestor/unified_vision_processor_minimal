# Vision Processor Simplification Summary

## What We Removed

### 1. Production Schema Complexity ❌ → ✅
- **Before**: 55 predefined fields with lowercase_underscore naming (`date_a_li`, `total_a_pg`)
- **After**: Simple set of common field names that extractors actually produce (`DATE`, `TOTAL`, `GST`)
- **Result**: `core_fields_found` now properly counts extracted fields

### 2. 7-Step Pipeline Orchestrator ❌
- **Removed**: Complex 7-step processing pipeline (Classification → Primary Extraction → AWK Fallback → Validation → ATO Compliance → Confidence Scoring → Recommendations)
- **Simplified to**: Just Primary Extraction + AWK Fallback
- **Reason**: Massive overcomplication - only need primary extraction with AWK as a fallback

### 3. Schema Field Mapping ❌ → ✅  
- **Before**: Complex mapping from extracted fields to production schema names
- **After**: Direct use of extracted field names
- **Result**: No more mismatch causing `core_fields_found=0`

## What We Created

### 1. PatternLibrary ✅
- Centralized all regex patterns and field extraction logic
- Eliminated duplication across extractors
- Single source of truth for field patterns

### 2. BaseExtractor ✅
- Abstract base class with shared extraction logic
- Unified result model (ExtractionResult)
- Common field validation and cleaning

### 3. Simplified Core Fields ✅
```python
CORE_FIELDS = {
    "DATE", "TOTAL", "GST", "ABN", "SUPPLIER_NAME",
    "INVOICE_NUMBER", "AMOUNT", "DESCRIPTION",
    "BSB", "ACCOUNT_NUMBER", "BUSINESS_NAME", "RECEIPT_NUMBER"
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplicity**: Removed unnecessary complexity
2. **Accuracy**: Core fields are now properly counted
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized patterns and logic
4. **Compatibility**: Still works with existing model comparison pipeline

## Test Results

```
✅ Structured Response: 7 fields extracted, 7 core fields found
✅ Banking Document: 5 fields extracted, 5 core fields found  
✅ Raw Markdown: 1 field extracted, 1 core field found
```

## Next Steps

The system is now simplified and working correctly. When you run the model comparison:

```bash
python model_comparison.py compare \
  --datasets-path ./datasets \
  --output-dir ./results \
  --models llama,internvl
```

The CSV output will now show accurate `core_fields_found` values instead of 0.
