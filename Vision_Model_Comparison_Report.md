## üèóÔ∏è Production POD Sizing Requirements

![Production Memory Requirements](remote_results/production_memory_requirements.png)

### Kubernetes POD Resource Specifications

#### Memory Monitoring Results - Data Quality Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **MEMORY DATA ANOMALIES DETECTED**: While individual measurements are now captured, the values show illogical patterns.

**Measured Values (Questionable):**
- **Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct**: **2.05GB process, 10.57GB GPU**
- **InternVL3-2B**: **4.25GB process, 2.27GB GPU**

**Critical Data Quality Issues:**
- üö® **Illogical**: 11B model shows lower process memory than 2B model
- üö® **Insufficient snapshots**: Both models show only 1 snapshot, 0.0s monitoring duration
- üö® **No peak capture**: Memory monitoring appears to capture only initialization, not peak processing

**Likely Cause**: Memory snapshots are being taken before/after processing rather than during actual model inference when peak memory usage occurs.

#### Memory Monitoring Still Needs Fix
‚ùå **MONITORING INCOMPLETE**: Current system captures model loading memory, not inference peak memory usage.

#### POD Configuration - Based on Unreliable Data
‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: POD configurations below are based on questionable memory measurements and should not be used for production deployment.

#### Placeholder POD Configuration (Data Quality Issues)
```yaml
# ‚ùå DO NOT USE - Based on incomplete memory monitoring
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "TBD"       # Requires accurate peak memory measurements
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # GPU requirements appear accurate
  limits:
    memory: "TBD"       # Cannot calculate without reliable process memory data
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#### 4GB Pod Compliance Analysis - INVALID
‚ùå **CANNOT DETERMINE**: Memory measurements are unreliable and cannot be used for pod sizing decisions.

**Data Quality Problems:**
1. **Illogical size correlation**: 11B model showing less memory than 2B model
2. **Missing peak measurements**: Only 1 snapshot per model with 0.0s duration  
3. **No inference monitoring**: Appears to capture only model loading, not processing peaks

**Required Fix:**
- Memory monitoring needs to capture snapshots **during** image processing inference
- Multiple snapshots throughout the processing pipeline to identify true peak usage
- Validate that larger models show higher memory consumption as expected

**Status**: POD sizing requirements **cannot be determined** until memory monitoring captures actual inference peaks.

### Memory Analysis for Production Deployment

| Resource Component | Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct | InternVL3-2B | Data Quality Assessment |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **GPU VRAM Required** | 10.57GB | 2.27GB | ‚úÖ **Credible** - Larger model uses more VRAM |
| **V100 VRAM Utilization** | 66% (manageable) | 14% (excellent) | ‚úÖ **Logical** - Both V100 compatible |
| **Process Memory** | 2.05GB | 4.25GB | ‚ùå **ILLOGICAL** - 11B model less than 2B model |
| **4GB Pod Compliance** | ‚ùì **Unknown** | ‚ùì **Unknown** | ‚ùå **Cannot determine** - unreliable data |
| **Memory Monitoring Quality** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 snapshot, 0.0s** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 snapshot, 0.0s** | ‚ùå **Insufficient** - no peak capture |


#### Production Deployment Recommendations - SUSPENDED

‚ùå **RECOMMENDATIONS SUSPENDED**: Cannot provide reliable deployment guidance due to memory monitoring data quality issues.

**GPU VRAM Requirements (Credible Data):**
- **Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct**: 10.57GB VRAM (66% V100 utilization)
- **InternVL3-2B**: 2.27GB VRAM (14% V100 utilization) 

**Process Memory Requirements (Unreliable Data):**
- **Cannot determine**: Current measurements show illogical patterns
- **Required**: Fix memory monitoring to capture inference peaks
- **POD sizing**: Suspended until reliable memory data available

**Next Steps:**
1. **Fix memory monitoring** to capture snapshots during model inference
2. **Validate measurements** ensure larger models show higher memory usage
3. **Re-run comparison** with corrected monitoring system
4. **Update recommendations** based on reliable memory data
