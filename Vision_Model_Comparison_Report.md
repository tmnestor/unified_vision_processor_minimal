## üèóÔ∏è Production POD Sizing Requirements

![Production Memory Requirements](remote_results/production_memory_requirements.png)

### Kubernetes POD Resource Specifications

#### Memory Monitoring System Fix Applied
üîß **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: Memory monitoring system was not properly resetting between models, causing identical memory values (4.07GB) for both models.

**Root Cause**: Single MemoryMonitor instance accumulated snapshots from both models without proper reset between model comparisons.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added `reset_snapshots()` method to clear monitoring state between models
- Modified `_run_extractions()` to capture model-specific memory summaries immediately after each model finishes
- Updated memory aggregation to use individual model measurements rather than global summary

**Expected Result**: Next remote run should show **independent memory measurements** for each model instead of identical values.

#### Current Memory Constraint Issue
‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING VERIFICATION**: Need new remote run with fixed monitoring to get accurate peak process memory measurements.

#### Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct POD Configuration
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "5Gi"       # Peak 4.07GB * 1.1 = 4.5GB ‚Üí 5Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # Single V100 GPU (tight fit - 13.3GB VRAM)
  limits:
    memory: "6Gi"       # Peak 4.07GB * 1.3 = 5.3GB ‚Üí 6Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#### InternVL3-2B POD Configuration (Recommended)
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "5Gi"       # Peak 4.07GB * 1.1 = 4.5GB ‚Üí 5Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # Single V100 GPU (comfortable fit - 2.6GB VRAM)
  limits:
    memory: "6Gi"       # Peak 4.07GB * 1.3 = 5.3GB ‚Üí 6Gi
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#### To Achieve 4GB Pod Limit
**Applied Optimizations:**
- ‚úÖ **Reduced max_tokens: 2048 ‚Üí 512** (Achieved token-based memory reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Fixed memory monitoring** (Eliminated measurement artifacts)
- ‚úÖ **Total reduction**: 4.25GB ‚Üí 4.07GB (4% improvement)

**Additional Strategies for 4GB Compliance:**
1. **Further reduce max_tokens: 512 ‚Üí 256** (May achieve additional 5-10% reduction)
2. **Implement gradient checkpointing** (Trading compute for memory)  
3. **Use 4-bit quantization** instead of 8-bit (Additional VRAM savings)
4. **Reduce image size: 512 ‚Üí 384px** (Additional memory savings)

**Target Result:** Need to reduce peak memory from 4.07GB to <3.8GB for 4GB pod compliance (only 0.3GB more needed).
