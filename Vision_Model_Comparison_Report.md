## 🏗️ Production POD Sizing Requirements

![Production Memory Requirements](remote_results/production_memory_requirements.png)

### Kubernetes POD Resource Specifications

#### Current Memory Constraint Issue
⚠️ **Both models currently exceed 4GB pod limit** with peak process memory at **4.25GB**.

#### Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct POD Configuration
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "5Gi"       # Requires >4GB (4.25GB peak process memory)
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # Single V100 GPU (tight fit - 13.3GB VRAM)
  limits:
    memory: "6Gi"       # Minimum viable limit
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#### InternVL3-2B POD Configuration (Recommended)
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "5Gi"       # Requires >4GB (4.25GB peak process memory)
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1   # Single V100 GPU (comfortable fit - 2.6GB VRAM)
  limits:
    memory: "6Gi"       # Minimum viable limit
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
```

#### To Achieve 4GB Pod Limit
**Memory Optimization Strategies:**
1. **Reduce max_tokens: 1024 → 512** (Expected ~15-20% memory reduction)
2. **Implement gradient checkpointing** (Trading compute for memory)
3. **Use 4-bit quantization** instead of 8-bit (Additional VRAM savings)
4. **Reduce image processing batch size** (If applicable)

**Estimated Result:** These optimizations should bring peak memory to ~3.4-3.8GB, enabling 4GB pod deployment.
