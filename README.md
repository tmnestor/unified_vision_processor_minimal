# Vision Model Comparison Framework

A pure model comparison system designed to answer the critical question: **"Which vision model better understands business documents?"** This framework provides unbiased, reproducible comparisons between InternVL3 and Llama-3.2-Vision models on real-world document understanding tasks.

## 🎯 Overview

This codebase implements a fair, transparent comparison methodology for evaluating vision language models on business document understanding. By preserving raw model outputs and avoiding processing bias, it enables objective assessment of each model's capabilities.

## 🚀 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - July 2025**

**Llama 3.2 Vision Performance Optimization**: We've implemented the official HuggingFace chat template format for Llama-3.2-Vision-Instruct, delivering massive performance improvements:

### **Results:**
- **📉 73% Token Reduction**: 811 characters vs 3000+ characters per response
- **⚡ 58% Faster Processing**: 29.6 seconds vs 70+ seconds per document  
- **✅ Complete Field Extraction**: All 26 fields now extracted reliably (including previously missing SUBTOTAL)
- **🎯 Production Ready**: Fits comfortably within 2024 max token limits

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Official Chat Template**: Uses `processor.apply_chat_template()` with proper message structure
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically falls back to manual format if needed
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Maintains full compatibility with existing functionality
- **Debug Tracking**: Clear logging shows which approach is being used

This breakthrough makes Llama 3.2 Vision significantly more viable for production document processing applications.

### Core Principles

- **Unbiased Comparison**: Raw model outputs preserved without favoring any specific format
- **Identical Prompts**: Both models receive exactly the same instructions
- **No Post-Processing**: Model responses analyzed as-is, without extraction logic that could introduce bias
- **Reproducible Results**: Complete output preservation enables re-analysis and validation
- **Production Constraints**: Designed for real-world deployment on V100 16GB GPUs

## 🏗️ Comparison Architecture

The framework implements a pure comparison pipeline:

```
Document Image → Unified Prompt → Vision Model → Raw Output Capture → Analysis → Comparison Report
```

### Key Components for Fair Comparison

- **ComparisonRunner**: Orchestrates unbiased model evaluation across all test images
- **Analysis Dictionary**: Preserves complete model outputs without interpretation
- **Model Registry**: Ensures identical configuration for both models
- **Memory Monitor**: Tracks resource usage for performance comparison
- **Unified Prompts**: Guarantees both models receive identical instructions

## 🚀 Quick Start - Model Comparison

### Prerequisites

1. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate unified_vision_processor
```

2. Configure model paths in `model_comparison.yaml`:
```yaml
model_paths:
  llama: "/path/to/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct"
  internvl: "/path/to/InternVL3-8B"
```

### Primary Usage - Running Model Comparisons

```bash
# Run the main comparison - this is the core purpose of the codebase
python model_comparison.py

# This will:
# 1. Load both vision models sequentially (V100-optimized)
# 2. Process all 25 test images with each model
# 3. Capture raw, unprocessed outputs from each model
# 4. Display side-by-side comparison of what each model "sees"
# 5. Generate performance metrics and analysis
```

### Additional Tools

```bash
# Compare models on a specific document
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli compare datasets/image14.png

# Test individual model (for debugging)
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png --model llama

# Extract with different output format
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png --output-format json
```

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed debug output (raw responses, parsing info):
```bash
# Enable debug mode
export VISION_DEBUG=true
python model_comparison.py

# Disable debug mode (default)
export VISION_DEBUG=false
python model_comparison.py
```

### **🔍 Monitoring the Chat Template Optimization**

When running the comparison, look for these indicators in the logs:

**✅ Success (Chat Template Working):**
```
✅ Chat template applied successfully - using official format
```

**⚠️ Fallback (Manual Format Used):**
```
⚠️ Chat template failed, falling back to manual format: [error details]
```

**📊 Expected Performance (Llama 3.2 Vision):**
- **Response Length**: ~800 characters (vs 3000+ before)
- **Processing Time**: ~30 seconds (vs 70+ seconds before)
- **Field Extraction**: All 26 fields including SUBTOTAL
- **Output Format**: Concise key-value pairs without verbose explanations

## ⚙️ Configuration

**CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION**: All configuration parameters are now in YAML files as the single source of truth. No hardcoded values remain in the code, enabling easy debugging and tuning without code changes.

The system uses YAML-based configuration with two main files:

### model_comparison.yaml
Primary configuration for model paths, device settings, and ALL comparison parameters:
```yaml
# Model paths
model_paths:
  llama: "/path/to/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct"
  internvl: "/path/to/InternVL3-8B"

# Quality rating thresholds (realistic for business documents)
quality_thresholds:
  excellent: 12    # 12+ fields = Excellent (nearly half of possible fields)
  good: 8          # 8-11 fields = Good (solid extraction)
  fair: 5          # 5-7 fields = Fair (basic extraction)
  poor: 0          # <5 fields = Poor

# Processing speed rating thresholds (realistic for H200/V100 hardware)
speed_thresholds:
  very_fast: 15.0  # <15s = Very Fast (optimized)
  fast: 25.0       # 15-25s = Fast (good performance)
  moderate: 40.0   # 25-40s = Moderate (acceptable)

# Expected fields for extraction (26 fields total)
expected_fields:
  - DOCUMENT_TYPE
  - SUPPLIER
  - ABN
  # ... (full list of 26 fields)
# Note: ALL 26 fields are compared - no arbitrary subset

# Memory and hardware configuration
memory_config:
  v100_limit_gb: 16.0      # V100 GPU memory limit
  safety_margin: 0.85      # Use 85% of available memory

# Image processing configuration  
image_processing:
  max_image_size: 1024     # Maximum image dimension
  timeout_seconds: 10      # Processing timeout

# Repetition control configuration
repetition_control:
  enabled: true               # Enable repetition detection
  word_threshold: 0.15        # 15% word repetition threshold
  phrase_threshold: 2         # 2 phrase repetitions trigger cleaning
  fallback_max_tokens: 1000   # Fallback token limit

# Model-specific configurations
model_config:
  llama:
    max_new_tokens_limit: 2024  # Token generation limit
    confidence_score: 0.85      # Default confidence
  internvl:
    max_new_tokens_limit: 2024  # Token generation limit
    confidence_score: 0.95      # Default confidence
```

### model_comparison.yaml
All field extraction configuration and prompts are defined in `model_comparison.yaml`:
```yaml
key_schema:
  required_keys:
    - DATE
    - STORE
    - TOTAL
    - GST
    - ABN
  optional_keys:
    - ITEMS
    - QUANTITIES
    - PRICES
    # ... additional fields
```

## 📊 CLI Commands

### Document Extraction
```bash
# Single document extraction
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png

# Extract with model override
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png --model llama

# Extract with output format override  
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png --output-format json

# Model comparison on specific document
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli compare datasets/image14.png

# Batch processing
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli batch ./datasets/ --output-dir ./results/
```

### Model Evaluation
```bash
# Run full comparison
python model_comparison.py

# Evaluate specific models
python -m vision_processor.cli.evaluation_cli compare evaluation_ground_truth.csv \
    --models internvl3,llama32_vision \
    --output-dir results

# Benchmark single model
python -m vision_processor.cli.evaluation_cli benchmark datasets --model internvl3
```

## 🔑 Field Extraction

The system dynamically extracts fields based on the `expected_fields` list defined in `model_comparison.yaml`:

**Required Fields**: Must be present for successful extraction
- DATE, STORE, TOTAL, GST, ABN

**Optional Fields**: Extracted when present in the document
- ITEMS, QUANTITIES, PRICES, RECEIPT_NUMBER, PAYMENT_METHOD, etc.

Fields can be added or modified by editing the `expected_fields` list in `model_comparison.yaml` without changing any code.

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

### Running Tests
```bash
# Test single extraction
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli extract datasets/image14.png

# Run complete model comparison
python model_comparison.py

# Validate configuration
python -m vision_processor.cli.simple_extract_cli config-info
```

### Current Evaluation Metrics
The system currently measures:
- **Processing Speed**: Time per document
- **Response Length**: Average character count of model outputs
- **Memory Usage**: GPU memory consumption during inference
- **Output Format**: Observation of response patterns (structured vs. markdown vs. OCR)

Note: The system preserves all data needed for quality comparison but does not currently implement automated scoring.

## 🔍 Pure Model Comparison Architecture

### Field Extraction Comparison

The framework now implements comprehensive field-by-field comparison:

**The Crucial Metrics**:

1. **Average Fields Extracted**: Mean number of fields (out of 26) that each model successfully extracts per document
   - This metric best answers "Which model better understands business documents?"
   - Shows instruction following, document comprehension, and extraction completeness
   - **Realistic quality ratings**: Excellent (12+), Good (8-11), Fair (5-7), Poor (<5)
   - Note: Most business documents won't have all 26 fields - invoices lack bank info, statements lack invoice details

2. **Average Processing Time**: Mean time (in seconds) each model takes to process a document
   - Critical for production deployment and user experience
   - Determines throughput and scalability
   - **Realistic speed ratings**: Very Fast (<15s), Fast (15-25s), Moderate (25-40s), Slow (>40s)
   - Trade-off analysis: extraction quality vs. processing speed

**Additional Metrics**:
- **Extraction Rate**: How often each model successfully extracts each of the 26 defined fields
- **Value Rate**: How often extracted fields contain actual values (not "N/A")
- **Top Fields**: Which fields are most reliably extracted by each model
- **Key Field Comparison**: Direct comparison on critical fields (DOCUMENT_TYPE, SUPPLIER, TOTAL, GST, ABN)
- **Winner Declaration**: Clear statement of which model extracts more fields on average

**Analysis Approach**:
1. Both models receive identical prompts requesting 26 specific fields
2. Responses are parsed to extract KEY: VALUE pairs
3. Extracted fields are stored in `extracted_fields` dictionary
4. Field-by-field comparison shows extraction success rates
5. Raw responses are preserved for additional analysis

**What's NOT implemented**:
- Semantic accuracy validation (comparing extracted values to ground truth)
- Fuzzy matching for similar but not exact field values
- Confidence scoring for individual extractions

### The Analysis Dictionary

At the heart of the comparison system is the `analysis_dict`, a carefully designed data structure that captures the complete, unbiased output from each vision model. This approach ensures fair comparison by preserving raw model capabilities without imposing any post-processing that might favor one model over another.

#### Structure and Purpose

```python
analysis_dict = {
    "img_name": image_path.name,           # Name of the image file being processed
    "raw_response": response.raw_text,     # Complete, unmodified output from the model
    "model_name": model_name,              # Which model produced this result (llama/internvl)
    "processing_time": response.processing_time,  # How long the model took to process
    "response_length": len(response.raw_text),   # Character count of the response
    "successful": True,                    # Always True for raw comparison (no validation)
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),      # When this processing occurred
    "extracted_fields": {                  # Parsed KEY: VALUE pairs from the response
        "DOCUMENT_TYPE": "Invoice",
        "SUPPLIER": "Telstra Limited",
        "ABN": "64 086 174 781",
        "TOTAL": "$65.00",
        # ... up to 26 fields as defined in prompt
    }
}
```

#### Key Benefits

1. **Complete Output Preservation**: The `raw_response` field stores exactly what each model generates, including:
   - Properly formatted KEY: VALUE pairs
   - Markdown-formatted responses
   - OCR fallback outputs (marked with `<OCR/>`)
   - Any model-specific formatting quirks

2. **Fair Comparison**: By avoiding any extraction or parsing logic in the data collection phase, we ensure:
   - No bias toward models that output specific formats
   - Complete visibility into what each model "sees" in documents
   - Ability to analyze different response strategies

3. **Performance Tracking**: Processing time and response length provide insights into:
   - Model efficiency on different document types
   - Trade-offs between speed and output quality
   - Resource utilization patterns

4. **Traceability**: The combination of image name, model name, and timestamp enables:
   - Reproducible comparisons
   - Debugging of model behavior on specific images
   - Historical analysis of model improvements

#### Usage in the Pipeline

The `analysis_dict` flows through the comparison pipeline as follows:

1. **Collection Phase**: Each model processes each image, generating an `analysis_dict`
2. **Aggregation**: Dictionaries are collected in `extraction_results[model_name]`
3. **Analysis**: The raw data feeds into performance metrics and comparison reports
4. **Export**: Complete results can be exported for further analysis

This architecture exemplifies the principle of "measure first, interpret later" - by preserving complete model outputs, researchers can apply different analysis approaches without re-running expensive model inference.

    REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (output ALL lines exactly as shown):
    DOCUMENT_TYPE: [value or N/A]
    SUPPLIER: [value or N/A]
    ABN: [11-digit Australian Business Number or N/A]
    # ... all 26 fields
    STOP after the 26 lines above. Do not add explanations, notes, or additional text.
    
  llama: |
    Extract data from this business document. Output ALL fields below with their exact keys.
    # Same 26 fields as internvl - processed through official chat template
```
