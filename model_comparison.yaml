# Model Comparison Configuration
# Contains all settings for model comparison: fields, prompts, success criteria, and generation parameters



# Success criteria and quality thresholds
min_fields_for_success: 5  # Document is successful if it extracts at least 5 fields (20% of total)

# Quality rating thresholds for field extraction (realistic for business documents)
quality_thresholds:
  excellent: 12    # 12+ fields = Excellent (nearly half of possible fields)
  good: 8          # 8-11 fields = Good (solid extraction)
  fair: 5          # 5-7 fields = Fair (basic extraction)
  poor: 0          # <5 fields = Poor

# Processing speed rating thresholds (seconds per document - realistic for H200/V100)
speed_thresholds:
  very_fast: 15.0  # <15s = Very Fast (optimized)
  fast: 25.0       # 15-25s = Fast (good performance)
  moderate: 40.0   # 25-40s = Moderate (acceptable)
                   # >40s = Slow (needs optimization)

# Memory and hardware configuration
memory_config:
  v100_limit_gb: 16.0      # V100 GPU memory limit (16GB VRAM)
  safety_margin: 0.85      # Use 85% of available memory for safety
  # Note: v100_limit_gb is used by both memory monitoring and device configuration
  
# Image processing configuration  
image_processing:
  max_image_size: 512      # Maximum image dimension for resizing (reduced for 4GB pod limit)
  timeout_seconds: 30      # Processing timeout per image (30s for complex documents)

# Token limits configuration - single source of truth
token_limits:
  max_tokens: 512          # Maximum tokens for generation (reduced for 4GB pod limit)
  # Note: This value is used for max_tokens, max_new_tokens_limit, and fallback_max_tokens

# Field extraction configuration
# Fields are parsed dynamically from the extraction_prompt using regex pattern matching

# CLI defaults
defaults:
  datasets_path: "/home/jovyan/nfs_share/tod/datasets"  # Absolute path for all environments
  max_tokens: 512  # Default max tokens for generation

  output_dir: "/home/jovyan/nfs_share/tod/output"  # Absolute path for all environments
  models: "llama,internvl"  # Default models to compare

# Model-specific configurations
model_config:
  llama:

# Post-processing configuration
post_processing:
  enabled: true               # Keep post-processing enabled (some responses still need markdown cleaning)

  force_parsing: false        # Force field parsing even with clean output

# Field importance weights for analysis and metrics
# All fields discovered from extraction_prompt automatically get weight 1.0
# To override specific field weights, uncomment and modify:
# field_weights:
#   DOCUMENT_TYPE: 2.0  # Example: Make document type twice as important
#   TOTAL: 1.5         # Example: Make total amount 50% more important
  
# Repetition control configuration  
repetition_control:
  enabled: true               # Default: ON for both models
  word_threshold: 0.15        # Word repetition threshold
