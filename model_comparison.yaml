# Model Comparison Configuration
# Contains all settings for model comparison: fields, prompts, success criteria, and generation parameters



# Success criteria - simplified
min_fields_for_success: 1  # Document is successful if it extracts at least 1 fields

# CLI defaults
defaults:
  datasets_path: "datasets"  # Default datasets directory
  max_tokens: 800  # Increased to allow complete 20-field key-value extraction
  quantization: true  # Enable 8-bit quantization for V100
  output_dir: "results"  # Default output directory
  models: "llama,internvl"  # Default models to compare
  trust_remote_code: true  # Enable custom model architectures (InternVL requires this)

# Device configuration for V100 production deployment
device_config:
  # GPU allocation strategy
  gpu_strategy: "single_gpu"  # Options: single_gpu, multi_gpu, auto
  target_gpu: 0  # Which GPU to use for single_gpu mode
  
  # V100 production constraints (16GB VRAM, 64GB RAM)
  v100_mode: true  # Enable V100 production optimizations
  memory_limit_gb: 16  # GPU memory limit for V100
  
  # Device mapping configurations per model
