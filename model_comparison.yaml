# Model Comparison Configuration
# Contains all settings for model comparison: fields, prompts, success criteria, and generation parameters



# Success criteria and quality thresholds
min_fields_for_success: 1  # Document is successful if it extracts at least 1 fields

# Quality rating thresholds for field extraction (realistic for business documents)
quality_thresholds:
  excellent: 12    # 12+ fields = Excellent (nearly half of possible fields)
  good: 8          # 8-11 fields = Good (solid extraction)
  fair: 5          # 5-7 fields = Fair (basic extraction)
  poor: 0          # <5 fields = Poor

# Processing speed rating thresholds (seconds per document - realistic for H200/V100)
speed_thresholds:
  very_fast: 15.0  # <15s = Very Fast (optimized)
  fast: 25.0       # 15-25s = Fast (good performance)
  moderate: 40.0   # 25-40s = Moderate (acceptable)
                   # >40s = Slow (needs optimization)

# Memory and hardware configuration
memory_config:
  v100_limit_gb: 16.0      # V100 GPU memory limit

    You are a helpful assistant. When responding, do not use asterisks (*) for emphasis or bold formatting. Use plain text only without any markdown formatting symbols.
